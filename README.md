## 📌 Overview

This project builds a **Diabetes Risk Prediction system** using multiple machine learning models and serves it via a **Streamlit web app**. The app collects patient inputs and predicts diabetes risk using an ensemble of models.

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🔍 Predict diabetes risk from patient inputs
* 🌲 Uses 3 ML models:

  * Random Forest
  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree
* 📊 Displays individual model predictions + average risk
* ⚡ Fast predictions using pre-trained models
* 🌐 Interactive UI with Streamlit

## 🧠 Models Used

* Random Forest Regressor
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor

👉 Final prediction = **Average of all 3 models** fileciteturn1file7

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Uses sklearn diabetes dataset
* Splits into train/test
* Applies StandardScaler fileciteturn1file6

---

### 2. Model Training

* Trains 3 models
* Saves them using pickle
* Saves scaler for inference fileciteturn1file8

---

### 3. Prediction

* Loads saved models
* Scales input
* Returns predictions from all models fileciteturn1file5

### 4. Evaluation

* Uses R² score for performance comparison fileciteturn1file4

### 5. Web App

* Takes user input (age, BMI, etc.)
* Shows prediction instantly
* Displays model-wise output fileciteturn1file1

## 📊 Results

* Multiple models improve reliability
* Ensemble average gives stable prediction
* Random Forest usually performs best

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Streamlit
* Pickle

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Convert to classification (diabetic / non-diabetic)
* Add probability-based risk score
* Deploy on cloud (Streamlit Cloud)
* Add explainability (SHAP)
